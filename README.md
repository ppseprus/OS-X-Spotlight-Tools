# OS X Spotlight Tools


I use Spotlight Comments to tag my files; the tags are separated with whitespaces and each of them start with the ```&``` symbole. Something like this: ```&tag1 &tag2 &tag3```

I've been tagging my files for a few years now; moving from one drive to another. And from time to time, I end up messing up something. That's why, through out the years, I created a set of scripts to maintain order. I want to share them with You!
